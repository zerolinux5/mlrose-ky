    Base class for mutation operations in a genetic algorithm.

    This class provides a structured way to define mutation operations that
    can be applied to genetic algorithm populations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    optimization_problem : Any
        The optimization problem instance associated with the mutation operations.
    chromosome_length : int
        The length of the chromosome in the genetic algorithm, derived from the optimization problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    optimization_problem : Any
        An instance of an optimization problem that the mutator will operate on.

        Apply mutation operation to a given child chromosome based on a mutation probability.

        Parameters
        ----------
        child : np.ndarray
            The chromosome of a child individual to be mutated.
        mutation_probability : float
            The probability of each gene being mutated.

        Returns
        -------
        Any
            The mutated chromosome.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the mutation_probability is not within the range [0, 1].
