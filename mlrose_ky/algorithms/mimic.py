    """Use MIMIC to find the optimum for a given optimization problem.

    Note
    ----
    MIMIC cannot be used for solving continuous-state optimization problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem: optimization object
        Object containing fitness function optimization problem to be solved.
        For example, :code:`DiscreteOpt()` or :code:`TSPOpt()`.
    pop_size: int, default: 200
        Size of population to be used in algorithm.
    keep_pct: float, default: 0.2
        Proportion of samples to keep at each iteration of the algorithm,
        expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
    max_attempts: int, default: 10
        Maximum number of attempts to find a better neighbor at each step.
    max_iters: int, default: np.inf
        Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.
    curve: bool, default: False
        Boolean to keep fitness values for a curve.
        If :code:`False`, then no curve is stored.
        If :code:`True`, then a history of fitness values is provided as a
        third return value.
    random_state: int, default: None
        If random_state is a positive integer, random_state is the seed used
        by np.random.seed(); otherwise, the random seed is not set.
    state_fitness_callback: function taking five parameters, default: None
        If specified, this callback will be invoked once per iteration.
        Parameters are (iteration, max attempts reached?, current best state, current best fit, user callback data).
        Return true to continue iterating, or false to stop.
    callback_user_info: any, default: None
        User data passed as last parameter of callback.
    noise: float, default: 0.0
        Noise level to be added to the fitness function,
        expressed as a value between 0 and 0.1.

    Returns
    -------
    best_state: np.ndarray
        Numpy array containing state that optimizes the fitness function.
    best_fitness: float
        Value of fitness function at best state.
    fitness_curve: np.ndarray
        Numpy array containing the fitness at every iteration.
        Only returned if input argument :code:`curve` is :code:`True`.
