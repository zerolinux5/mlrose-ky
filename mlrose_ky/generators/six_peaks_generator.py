        Generate a Six Peaks optimization problem with a given seed, size, and threshold percentage.

        Parameters
        ----------
        seed : int
            The seed for the random number generator.
        size : int, optional
            The size of the problem (default is 20).
        threshold_percentage : float, optional
            The threshold percentage for the Six Peaks problem (default is 0.1).

        Returns
        -------
        DiscreteOpt
            An instance of DiscreteOpt configured with the specified parameters.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the size is not a positive integer or if the threshold_percentage is not between 0 and 1.
